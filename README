# OCP Advanced Analytics Tool
This tool is meant to be used to generate advanced analytics in the form of graphs to help evaluate OpenShift based k8s clusters.
Using a simple python container this tool generates the graphs then serves those graphs using a flask webserver within the container. Use `oc expose` to get external access from the cluster.

Use cases:
- Migration preparations
- Healthcheck evaulations
- General cluster metrics (Not meant as a replacement for Prometheus)

## Current features
- OCP `BuildConfig` source image stats (Pi and Bubble Charts)

## Installation
```
# Install using kustomize
oc apply -k deploy/overlay/app/

# Expose HTTPS Web Server
oc expose svc/adv-analytics
